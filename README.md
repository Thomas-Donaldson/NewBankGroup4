Trello board here: https://trello.com/b/P3aYABqK/new-bank-project-group-4

quickstart guide for git newcomers:
* install git on your machine
* make a directory on your machine to hold your local code repositories
* run `git clone https://github.com/Thomas-Donaldson/NewBankGroup4` to download the codebase
* I run Fedora, so I needed these steps to prepare to run the code:
  * `sudo dnf install httpd `
  * `systemctl start httpd.service`
  * `systemctl enable httpd.service`
* in "newbank/server/NewBankServer", run the `main()` method from your IDE
* in "newbank/client/ExampleClient", run the `main()` method from your IDE
* you can now interact with the service over your command line!

if you encounter any issues particular to your home machine, we can document those here also
